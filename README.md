# PHP Conditional HTML Element Rendering

A simple PHP example demonstrating conditional HTML element rendering based on user input. This code toggles the visibility of an element (`<h1>` tag) when the user enters "toggle" in the input field and submits the form.

### Features
- **Session-based state management:** Tracks the visibility state (`shown`) using PHP sessions.
- **Form validation:** Checks if user input matches "toggle" and alerts for invalid input.
- **Dynamic rendering:** Displays or hides HTML elements based on the state.

### Usage
1. Save this code as an `.php` file (e.g., `index.php`) and run it in a server environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, or any PHP-supported server).
2. Include your custom CSS file in `./assets/index.css` for styling and a JavaScript file in `assets/index.js` for additional functionality.
3. Open the webpage and use the input box to toggle the visibility of the message by entering "toggle".
